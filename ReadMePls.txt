Hello! To get the DM-All bot working you will need to have Node.js installed on your machine.

If you do not have it installed already, head over to http://nodejs.org/en/download download and install the latest version of node.

Once you have it installed, you will need to configure the the bot by opening the "config.json" file.

DO NOT open it in notepad. Use a code editor such as Notepad++, Atom or VS Code to open it. 

Inside of the "config.json" file, the code should look like this:

{
    "token": "YOUR_USER_TOKEN",
    "prefix": ";",
    "waitTime": 3000
}

Put your bot/user token on the second line where it says "YOUR_USER_TOKEN".

Read this  https://github.com/TheRacingLion/Discord-SelfBot/wiki/Discord-Token-Tutorial in case you don't know how to get your User token. 

You can also change the bot's prefix as well as the waitTime.

The wait time is in ms. DO NOT go below 3000ms or you will get errors.


Enjoy the bot! If you have any problems or you need help setting this up, you can contact me via PM on V3rmillion or Discord.
